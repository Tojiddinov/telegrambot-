# Notification Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis

Your Telegram bot was experiencing **403 Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user** errors after Railway deployment. This happens when:

1. Users block your bot on Telegram
2. Your bot continues trying to send them notifications
3. The Telegram API returns 403 errors
4. These errors were not properly handled, causing system issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Added detection for blocked user errors
- ✅ Added retry logic for temporary network issues
- ✅ Improved error logging and classification

### 2. User Status Management
- ✅ Automatically mark blocked users as inactive
- ✅ Stop sending notifications to blocked users
- ✅ Track blocked status in user database

### 3. Notification Filtering
- ✅ Skip notifications for blocked users
- ✅ Respect user notification preferences
- ✅ Prevent unnecessary API calls

### 4. Monitoring Tools
- ✅ Added `/notifications` command for statistics
- ✅ Created validation scripts for deployment
- ✅ Added notification testing capabilities

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
# Validate environment
npm run validate

# Test notification system
npm run test:notifications
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. Check Railway logs for any deployment issues

### Step 3: Verify Fix
1. Send `/start` to your bot
2. Send `/notifications` to check system status
3. Monitor Railway logs for 403 errors (should be much reduced)

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Constant 403 errors in logs
- ❌ Failed notification attempts to blocked users
- ❌ System resources wasted on failed requests
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Fix:
- ✅ Blocked users automatically detected and marked
- ✅ No more notifications sent to blocked users
- ✅ Clean error handling and logging
- ✅ Better system performance
- ✅ Useful monitoring via `/notifications` command

## Monitoring Commands

### For Users:
- `/start` - Basic bot functionality
- `/notifications` - View notification system status
- `/help` - Get help information

### For Development:
```bash
# Local validation
npm run validate

# Test notifications
npm run test:notifications

# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

## User Scenarios

### When a User Blocks the Bot:
1. ✅ Error is detected on first failed notification attempt
2. ✅ User is automatically marked as blocked
3. ✅ All future notifications are skipped for this user
4. ✅ System continues normally for other users

### When a User Unblocks the Bot:
1. ✅ User can send `/start` to reactivate
2. ✅ Bot will reset their blocked status automatically
3. ✅ Notifications resume normally

## Key Files Modified

1. **`src/services/notification.js`**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added blocked user management
   - Improved notification filtering

2. **`bot.js`**
   - Added `/notifications` command
   - Better error handling integration

3. **New files:**
   - `validate-env.js` - Environment validation
   - `test-notifications.js` - Notification testing
   - `NOTIFICATION_FIX.md` - This guide

## Expected Log Improvements

### Before:
```
ERROR: Failed to send prayer notification to user 705448186: Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user
ERROR: Failed to send task notification to user 705448186: Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user
```

### After:
```
WARN: User 705448186 has blocked the bot, marking user as inactive
INFO: User 705448186 marked as blocked and notifications disabled
DEBUG: Skipping notifications for blocked user 705448186
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see 403 errors:
1. Check if the new code deployed correctly
2. Restart the Railway service
3. Run `/notifications` command to see system status
4. Check Railway environment variables

### If notifications stop completely:
1. Verify notification service is running: `/notifications`
2. Check Railway logs for startup errors
3. Ensure BOT_TOKEN is correctly set
4. Run local validation: `npm run validate`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy these changes to Railway
2. ✅ Monitor logs for the next 24 hours
3. ✅ Test with real users
4. ✅ Use `/notifications` command to track system health

The notification system should now be much more robust and handle blocked users gracefully!
